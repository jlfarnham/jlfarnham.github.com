		<h1>Directions</h1>
		<ol>
			<li>Preheat your oven to 400 degrees</li>
			<li>Combine Bisquick with cold butter in a medium bowl using a pastry cutter or a large fork. You don't want to mix too thoroughly. There should be small chunks of butter in there that are about the size of peas. Add cheddar cheese, milk, and ¼ teaspoon garlic. Mix by hand until combined, but don't over mix.</li>
			<li>Drop approximately ¼-cup portions of the dough onto an ungreased cookie sheet using an ice cream scoop.</li>
			<li>Bake for 15 to 17 minutes or until the tops of the biscuits begin to turn light brown.</li>
			<li>When you take the biscuits out of the oven, melt 2 tablespoons butter is a small bowl in your microwave. Stir in ½ teaspoon garlic powder and the dried parsley flakes. Use a brush to spread this garlic butter over the tops of all the biscuits. Use up all of the butter. Makes one dozen biscuits.</li>
